## Emotion detection in song lyrics (P6)

Recently, emotion detection in text has received attention in the literature on sentiment analysis. Detecting emotions is important for studying human communication in different domains. Music is typically related to emotions, and song lyrics usually express emotions using different laguage styles. The project aims at studying song lyrics under the emotional profile. In particular, the task of the project is threefold:

Create a model to predict emotions in text using available datasets as EmoBank or WASSA-2017 as training sets;
Exploit the model to study emotions in song lyrics with the goal of undertanding how and if emotions are correlated with the music genre;
Automatically create a playlist based on lyrics given user preferences about music genres and the user current mood.
Dataset

See EmoBank and WASSA-2017 in the reference list below.

### Evaluation strategy

Cross-validation using the training set

## Suggestion

For a deeper understanding of the main code of the project, contained in the "Python Code" folder, it is suggested to read the "Sentiment Analysis Project - LATEX" document along the performed tasks, since it contains the main comments and results.
